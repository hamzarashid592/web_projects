				Avanza Solutions stands as a prominent FinTech solution provider in Pakistan, catering to a diverse clientele that includes major banks within the country and overseas. In my role, I engaged extensively with their banking switch systems, notably Rendezvous which is their enterprise middleware and their ATM controller, Nimbus.
				<br>
My tenure primarily centered around pivotal assignments at Meezan Bank Limited (MBL), the largest Islamic bank in Pakistan. Throughout this period, I spearheaded various Requests for Change (RFCs) that aimed at revolutionizing banking operations:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p class="lead my-2">MBL Direct Biller:</p>
						This RFC aimed to establish direct communication between the bank and billing companies, eliminating the need for a billing aggregator. This streamlined process resulted in significant savings for both parties by eliminating per transaction fees previously routed to the aggregator.
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="lead my-2">MBL Raast/MPG Phase II:</p>
						This initiative aimed to introduce P2P internet banking payments using an easily memorable alias rather than conventional account numbers or IBANs. Enabling customers to transact using the beneficiary’s cell number simplified the payment process, aligning with the State Bank of Pakistan's mandates to digitize and centralize the country’s banking industry.
						<br>
						MPG or Raast itself is sort of a country switch deployed at SBP. For more information click
						<a href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/dfs/Raast.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="lead my-2">MBL Wemsol Integration:</p>
						Tasked with integrating <a href="https://www.facebook.com/keenuwallet/" target="_blank">Keenu Wallet</a>, a Digital Wallet service by <a href="https://www.keenu.pk/Merchant/about-us/about-organization/"
						target="_blank">Wemsol Private
						Limited</a>, with ATM machines. This venture provided insights into ATM functionalities, communication with controllers, and middleware interactions. Since Keenu uses biometrics for customer authentication, my focus centered on biometric flow within the ATM context.
					</li>

					<li>
						<p class="lead my-2">ATM Biometric Activation:</p>
						To bolster security and prevent fraud in ATM biometric transactions, I facilitated the implementation of OTP authentication alongside biometric entry, enhancing transaction security protocols.
					</li>

					<li>
						<p class="lead my-2">Wallet Limit Segregation:</p>
						Implemented measures to reduce IBFT fraud by segregating transfer limits between normal bank accounts and their wallet counterparts, mitigating potential fraudulent activities.
					</li>

					<li>
						<p class="lead my-2">Nayapay Onus Acquiring:</p>
						Facilitated Nayapay Visa/Paypak cardholders to make withdrawals via MBL ATMs by establishing direct communication between MBL and Nayapay through their exposed APIs, bypassing the involvement of intermediary networks like 1Link.
					</li>
				</ul>
				These initiatives underscored the commitment to innovation and efficiency within the banking sector, enabling streamlined processes and enhanced security measures for financial transactions.

				<p>
					DreamBig Semiconductor, a forward-thinking US-based startup, specializes in delivering innovative smart NIC (Network Interface Card) solutions tailored for data centers. Within the team, my primary focus encompassed assignments centered around conducting in-depth research on OVS (Open vSwitch) hardware offloads and DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit).
					<br>
Moreover, I was entrusted by the company to look after the recruitment and training initiatives for its 2020 internship program. This responsibility allowed me to lead the identification of top talents and orchestrate a comprehensive training program, fostering a skilled and dynamic cohort poised to contribute to the company's growth and innovation.
					<br>Apart from that, I was also responsible for managing the connectivity of the office servers.
					Since the
					company was a startup so there were no strict protocols pertaining to server or VM management. This
					gave me a great opportunity to thrive and I gained a hands-on experience in installing and
					configuring
					Mellanox smart NICs. I also worked a great deal on QEMU/libvirt VMs, PCI passthrough (enabling
					direct access of PCI devices to VM's) and SRIOV.

					2019</div>
				<p>
					I completed a comprehensive 4-year Bachelor's program in Computer Systems Engineering from NED University of Engineering and Technology in Karachi. Throughout my academic tenure, I undertook various projects and delved deep into core courses that fortified my understanding of fundamental concepts in the field:
					<ul>
						<li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
						<li>Operating Systems</li>
						<li>Database Management Systems</li>
						<li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
						<li>Computer Architecture</li>
						<li>Distributed Systems</li>
						<li>Computer System Modeling</li>
					</ul>
					
					Among the many projects I undertook during my college years, two stand out as exemplary representations of my skills and dedication:
					<br>
					<b>Development of an 8-bit MIPS processor:</b> This project involved a complete implementation in Verilog, showcasing my proficiency in hardware description languages and digital design. The project underscored my ability to architect and execute complex systems at the hardware level.
					<br>
					<b>Creation of an OCR system for Urdu language:</b> This project highlighted my capability to merge linguistic understanding with technical expertise. Crafting an Optical Character Recognition system for Urdu required a deep understanding of language-specific challenges, image processing, and pattern recognition techniques.
					<br>
					These projects not only solidified my theoretical knowledge but also honed my practical skills, illustrating my capacity to innovate and solve real-world problems within the domain of computer systems engineering.

						Inspired by the <a
							href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.droid4you.application.wallet&hl=en&gl=US"
							target="_blank">Wallet</a>
						app, I developed the Batwa android app which serves as a free
						alternative. This was my first android project and I was able to learn a decent amount of
						android development using Kotlin by building this app. <br>I always found a personal finance
						tracking app really handy in running the expenses. Previously, I had bought Wallet’s
						subscription to do the job which is by the way a great app in this domain. After making my own
						app, I have completely shifted though it lags some features offered by Wallet.<br>
						Batwa app is not available on Play Store yet but can be found on <a
							href="https://github.com/hamzarashid592/Batwa" target="_blank">github</a>. Batwa is actually
						an
						Urdu word for Wallet.

					<div class="companyTenure h4">An OCR System for Urdu Language</div>
					<p>
						During my time at the university my Final Year Project was an OCR system for Urdu language
						(National language of Pakistan) which I implemented in Python.<br>
						The project had many stages, each of which required a different python library. For the
						segmentation stage, I heavily relied on Numpy while for the deep learning part, I used
						Tensorflow and Keras. I also tried to transfer the usage of Numpy library to Torch so that
						accelerated performance can be achieved via GPU.<br>
						This project had less accuracy but it was built entirely from scratch and further work is still
						being done at the university's research lab to enhance it.
