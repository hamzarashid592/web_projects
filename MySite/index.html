				<p>
					Avanza Solutions is one of Pakistan’s biggest FinTech solution provider. The major clientele
					includes some of the largest banks of Pakistan as well as abroad. My responsibilities include
					working with their banking switch i.e. Rendezvous and Nimbus which is their ATM controller.
					<br>My major assignments up till now have been with Meezan Bank Limited, MBL which is the largest
					Islamic
					bank of Pakistan.
					<br> During my tenure here I have done the following RFC's:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p class="lead my-2">MBL Direct Biller:</p>The aim of this RFC was to enable direct
						communication
						between
						the bank and billing companies and remove the involvement of the billing aggregator. By removing
						this involvement, both the parties are now able to save the per transaction fee which previously
						had to go to the aggregator.
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="lead my-2">MBL Raast/MPG Phase II:</p>
						The aim of this RFC was to introduce internet banking P2P payments via an easy to remember alias
						rather than an account number or IBAN. This enabled customers to use the beneficiary’s cell
						number to carry on with their payments rather than remembering a 14 digit account number or 34
						digit IBAN.<br>
						This was actually a small counterpart of a series of mandates put down by the State Bank of
						Pakistan, SBP with the aim of centralizing and digitizing the country’s banking industry.<br>
						MPG or Raast itself is sort of a country switch deployed at SBP. For more information click
						<a href="https://www.sbp.org.pk/dfs/Raast.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="lead my-2">MBL Wemsol Integration:</p>
						<a href="https://www.facebook.com/keenuwallet/" target="_blank">Keenu Wallet</a> is Digital
						Wallet service
						developed by <a href="https://www.keenu.pk/Merchant/about-us/about-organization/"
							target="_blank">Wemsol Private
							Limited</a>. In this RFC, the
						requirement was to facilitate Keenu customers to control their digital wallets via ATM machines.
						This assignment opened up a new and exciting domain for me as it gave me a gist of how ATM’s
						work, how ATM’s communicate with the controller and how the controller talks to the middleware.
						Since, Keenu uses biometric for its customer’s authentication, I only had to deal with the
						biometric flow concerning the ATM.

				<p>
					DreamBig Semiconductor is a US based startup geared towards providing a smart NIC (Network Interface
					Card) solution to data centers. I was one of the company’s earliest employees and a part of its
					software team. My major assignments in the team were concerned with doing research on OVS hardware
					offloads and DPDK. I had also been selected by the firm to leadthe hiring and training process of
					its 2020 internship program.
					<br>Apart from that, I was also responsible for managing the connectivity of the office servers.
					Since the
					company was a startup so there were no strict protocols pertaining to server or VM management. This
					gave me a great opportunity to thrive and I gained a hands-on experience in installing and
					configuring
					Mellanox smart NICs. I also worked a great deal on QEMU/libvirt VMs, PCI passthrough (enabling
					direct access of PCI devices to VM's) and SRIOV.

						Inspired by the <a
							href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.droid4you.application.wallet&hl=en&gl=US"
							target="_blank">Wallet</a>
						app, I developed the Batwa android app which serves as a free
						alternative. This was my first android project and I was able to learn a decent amount of
						android development using Kotlin by building this app. <br>I always found a personal finance
						tracking app really handy in running the expenses. Previously, I had bought Wallet’s
						subscription to do the job which is by the way a great app in this domain. After making my own
						app, I have completely shifted though it lags some features offered by Wallet.<br>
						Batwa app is not available on Play Store yet but can be found on <a
							href="https://github.com/hamzarashid592/Batwa" target="_blank">github</a>. Batwa is actually
						an
						Urdu word for Wallet.

					<p>
						During my time at the university my Final Year Project was an OCR system for Urdu language
						(National language of Pakistan) which I implemented in Python.<br>
						The project had many stages, each of which required a different python library. For the
						segmentation stage, I heavily relied on Numpy while for the deep learning part, I used
						Tensorflow and Keras. I also tried to transfer the usage of Numpy library to Torch so that
						accelerated performance can be achieved via GPU.<br>
						This project had less accuracy but it was built entirely from scratch and further work is still
						being done at the university's research lab to enhance it.
